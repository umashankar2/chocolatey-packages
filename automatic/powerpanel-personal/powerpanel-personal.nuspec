<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>An interface to control and monitor a UPS system through a USB or serial cable with the host computer.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[# PowerPanel® Personal

## Product Overview

PowerPanel® Personal is FREE software that features a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring any CyberPower UPS system through the USB or serial port. PowerPanel Personal can send email notifications when power events occur to keep you informed of power conditions at all times. The software monitors and tracks power consumed by the connected equipment to the UPS, and the user is able to see energy consumption and equivalent CO2 emissions.

PowerPanel® Personal provides configurable settings for managing automatic shutdowns during power outages, scheduled shutdowns, and restarts. The software displays important UPS operating information such as operating voltage, battery capacity, runtime, and load; in addition, it offers a self-test function, adjustable alarm settings, and more.

This software helps protect your data, computer system, components, and peripherals. It is compatible with Supported Operating Systems: Windows Server 2016 64/32bit, Windows Server 2012 R2 64bit, Windows Server 2012 64bit, Windows Server 2008 R2 64/32bit, Windows Server 2008 64/32bit, Windows 10 64/32bit, Windows 8 64/32bit, Windows 7 64/32bit.

* User-Friendly Interface

Provides an easy-to-use, intuitive user experience.

* Automated Unattended Shutdown

When the connected UPS detects a power outage, PowerPanel® Personal automatically triggers the computer to gracefully shutdown to prevent data loss, data corruption, or equipment damage.

* Email Notifications

PowerPanel® Personal allows users to setup email notifications to receive real-time alerts when the UPS registers a power event.

* Runtime Configuration

In the event of a power outage, the user can configure the software to keep the computer running until the battery power runs low, or to shut down the computer immediately after a power outage to preserve the battery.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
